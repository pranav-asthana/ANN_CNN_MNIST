## Machine Learning 2 Assignment 3
- Implement two neural networks for the handwritten digits recognition problem for the MNIST dataset
- The simple artificial neural network `ANN.py`
- The convolutional neural network `CNN.py`
- Install keras and Tensorflow in the virtualenv.
`pip3 install tensorflow`
`pip3 install keras`
- Dataset given in the folder `dataset` 

#### 1. ANN 
`python3 ANN.py`

Used the ReLU activation function over sigmoid and tanh for the hidden layers, since it gave the least error.  
#### 2. CNN
`python3 CNN.py`

Used the ReLU activation function over sigmoid and tanh for the hidden layers, since it gave the least error.
